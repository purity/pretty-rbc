[miscellaneous]

* if you're at the last instruction in a method and you enter the 'next' command, then
  the debugger behaves like the 'step' command was issued instead
* the zero pid applies the command to all the processes
* the 'step' command can be fooled by a loop that begins at the first instruction in some situations
* if the 'next' command is entered at a jump instruction then it always sets two separate breakpoints

[todo]

* integrate the debug globals into SharedState or do something similar
